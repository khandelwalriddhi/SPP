ðŸ“ˆ *Stock Price Prediction*

This project uses machine learning to predict future stock prices based on historical market data. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and model building using algorithms like Linear Regression, LSTM, or other predictive models. The goal is to provide a simple, intuitive tool to understand and forecast stock price trends.
